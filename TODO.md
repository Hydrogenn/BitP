- [ ] Create new (and seperate) compilers and editors
  - [ ] COMPILER
    - [ ] Compile the given script
    - [ ] Create a binary file
      - [ ] Decide whether to use .bpi ('bitp interpretable') or no extension
    - [ ] Take file input instead of defaulting to 'script.bp' at this directory
  - [ ] INTERPRETER
    - [ ] Read a given script and functions in a command line environment
    - [ ] Rewrite the given script file to the current state when exiting normally
    - [ ] Take file input instead of defaulting to 'script.bpi' at this directory
    - [ ] Seperate debug flag to print debug info
    - [ ] Seperate read flag to prevent writing over the script file
- [ ] Improve debugging
  - [ ] Reduce clutter
    - [ ] Stop displaying '..' when NOT skipped
    - [ ] Stop displaying '.' when NOT a value
  - [ ] Edit stack display
    - [ ] Show the selected value in the stack as the last one
    - [ ] Show the rest as beneath it
    - [ ] Show a '!' when nearing the disc limit
  - [ ] Breakpoint lookup
    - [ ] Take '*' to mean a break point in the script
      - [x] Does not add to the length of the bit script
      - [ ] Briefly stops the program for input
        - [ ] Input allows code injections
        - [ ] Input allows the code to continue
    - [ ] Force a breakpoint every some number of lines
  - [ ] Make printing great again
    - [ ] Show characters right after the debug string instead of right before the last
	- [ ] Show the accumulated characters right before the next input call
	- [x] Become president
  - [ ] Display the function character in addition to the numerical value

  - [x] Do not show the function character when looking at a numerical value
    - [ ] Show the remaining digits in place of it
- [ ] Create a Redcode implementation (Pifir Principle)
  - [ ] Load scripts 'red.bpr' and 'blue.bpr' instead of 'script.bp'
    - [ ] Places 'blue.bpr' at the end and backwards
    - [ ] 'blue.bpr' reads backwards
	- [ ] 'blue.bpr' goes to indexes backwards
  - [ ] Make 'TIME' output the number of cycles done since the beginning of the fight
  - [ ] Add option to disable any given function
  - [ ] Clean up the printing to display the character at the end of the debug and the total before input
  - [ ] Display the function character instead of the numerical value
    - [ ] Display the numerical value when actually looking at the value of
    - [ ] Do not display the '$' character when looking at a value to reduce clutter
