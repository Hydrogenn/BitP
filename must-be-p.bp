This program will continually ask for input until it sees the character "P".
'

'00' [					take input
'01' ,#5#0^				perform exclusive or with '50' which is the code point for 'P'
'07' ,#1#5@				goto '15' if that value is not zero (the only way it can be exactly zero is if the input itself is '50')
'0C' #1,#1#9@			else goto '19'
'15' #1,@				goto '0'
'19' --program end--	any goto after program termination will end program
